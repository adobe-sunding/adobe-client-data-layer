## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Adobe [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating,
you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to
[Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com).

## Ways of Contributing

There are many ways of contributing, from testing and reporting an issue to suggesting and coding full features. Below is a summary of some of the best ways to get involved. 

### Reporting Bugs üêõ

##### Before Reporting a Bug 

* Have a quick search through the currently open [bug reports](https://github.com/adobe/adobe-client-data-layer/labels/bug) to see if the issue has already been reported.
* Ensure that the issue is repeatable and that the actual behavior versus the expected results can be easily described.

##### Filing a Bug

1. Visit our [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/adobe-client-data-layer/issues).
1. File a `New Issue`.
1. Ensure your issue follows the [issue report guidelines](#issue-report-guidelines).
1. Thanks for the report! The committers will get back to you in a timely manner, typically within one week.

### Contributing Code üëæ 

High quality code is important to the project, and to keep it that way, all code submissions are reviewed by committers before being accepted. A close adherence to the guidelines below can help speed up the review process and increase the likelihood of the submission being accepted.

##### Before Contributing

* Create a [bug report](#reporting-bugs-) issue summarizing the problem that you will be solving. This will help with early feedback and tracking.
* Ensure you have [signed the Adobe Contributor License Agreement](http://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html). If you are an Adobe employee, you do not have to sign the CLA.

##### Contributing

The project accepts contributions primarily using GitHub pull requests. This process:
* Helps to maintain project quality
* Engages the community in working towards commonly accepted solutions with peer review
* Leads to a more meaningful and cleaner git history
* Ensures sustainable code management 

Creating a pull request involves creating a fork of the project in your personal space, adding your new code in a branch and triggering a pull request. Check the GitHub [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) article on how to perform pull requests.

Please base your pull request on the `master` branch and make sure to check you have incorporated or merged the latest changes!

The title of the pull request typically matches that of the issue it fixes, see the [issue report guidelines](#issue-report-guidelines).
Have a look at our [pull request template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to see what is expected to be included in the pull request description. The same template is available when the pull request is triggered.

##### Your first contribution
Would you would like to contribute to the project but don't have an issue in mind? Or are still fairly unfamiliar with the code? Then have a look at our [good first issues](https://github.com/adobe/adobe-client-data-layer/labels/good%20first%20issue), they are fairly simple starter issues that should only require a small amount of code and simple testing.

### Reviewing Code üëÄ

Reviewing others' code contributions is another great way to contribute - more eyes on the code help to improve its overall quality. To review a pull request, check the [open pull requests](https://github.com/adobe/adobe-client-data-layer/pulls) for anything you can comment on. 

### Documenting üìú

We very much welcome issue reports or pull requests that improve our documentation pages. While the best effort is made to keep them error free, useful and up-to-date there are always things that could be improved.

## Issue Report Guidelines

A well defined issue report will help in quickly understanding and replicating the problem faced, or the feature requested. Below are some guidelines on what to include when reporting an issue.

##### Title
* **Descriptive** - Should be specific, well described and readable at a glance.
* **Concise** - If the issue can't be easily described in a short title, then it is likely unfocused.
* **Keyword-rich** - Including keywords can help with quickly finding the issue in the backlog.

##### Description

See our [issue template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for details on what is expected to be described. The same information is available when creating a new issue on GitHub.

##### Labels

Once an issue is reported, the project committers will assign it a relevant label. You can see our [label list on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/adobe-client-data-layer/labels) to better understand what each label means.
